# TEAM-FIGHTCLUB---OPERATION-TRINETRA-2025
This project is a simple Secure Messenger that protects sensitive defense communication especially in military. It uses AES-256 to lock messages, RSA-2048 to secure keys, and SHA-256 to check integrity. Even if intercepted, the data looks random and unreadable without the private key, ensuring safe, trusted communication.

TRACK: Secure Military Communication Tools.

SECURE MESSENGER DEMO.

A simple project that shows how to keep messages safe using encryption. It was built as a demo for OPERATION TRINETRA 2025.

WHAT IT DOES?
MULTI-LAYER ENCRYPTION for better protection.

It lets you type a secret message.
Encrypts the message using AES-256.
Secures the encryption key with RSA-2048.
Checks message integrity with SHA-256.
Decrypts the message back safely.

ENCRYPTION ALGORITHM:

AES-256: Advanced encryption standard (Symmetric encryption).
RSA-2048 (Asymmetric encryption).
SHA-256: Secure hash algorithm (To verify integrity).

HOW TO RUN - BASIC IMPLEMENTATION USING PYTHON.

1. Install the required package: 
pip install pycryptodome

2. Run the program through Visual studio code or python interpreter.
secure_demo_io.py

Example output:
Enter a secret message: Defense Hackathon 2025  
[+] Encrypted Package (random bytes): (b'...', b'...', b'...')  
[+] Final Decrypted Message: Defense Hackathon 2025  

FUTURE SCOPE.
1. Convert into a real chat app.
2. Add secure file sharing.
3. Enable offline sync for remote areas.
4. KEY POINT: Add satellite communication to get easy access in no signal locations and it becomes further more secure.
