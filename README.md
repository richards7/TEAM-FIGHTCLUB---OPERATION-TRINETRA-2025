This project is a simple Secure Messenger that protects sensitive defense communication especially in military. It uses AES-256 to lock messages, RSA-2048 to secure keys, and SHA-256 to check integrity. Even if intercepted, the data looks random and unreadable without the private key, ensuring safe, trusted communication.
